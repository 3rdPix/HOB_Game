> A game about hacking - with its own programming language!

## About this branch

This branch is dedicated to the development of the HobL language. The implementation is done in the respective folder and can be tested in ´terminal.py´.

As mentioned, this game implements an environment for non-coders and developers to play a game that portraits the hacking experience seen in television and cinema. It does so, by creating scenarios that the player has to overcome creating functions and implementing them in [HobL](https://3rdpix.github.io/HOB_Game/). This is an invented scripting-like programming language which intends to be visually appealing (disclaimer: this is definitely not true from a developer's perspecetive, furthermore, HobL tries to be as far as possible from "clean, neat code") while being not hard to understand and learn so that new players can join the game without a very steep learning curve.

To achieve an increasing interest, the game can be played in its natural mode, which refers to the terminal environment with lines of code that need to be typed, or it can be played in block mode, where no code is required, but implementation of functions is done through interactions with the user interface.

HobL is fully implemented in Python and its documentation can be found in the GitHub's page of this repository: [here](https://3rdpix.github.io/HOB_Game/).
